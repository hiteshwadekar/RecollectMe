# RecollectMe
RecollectMe is an image memory tool which searches images based on description provided.

Problem Statement:-

Recent growth in storing contents in handheld smart devices such as cell phone, tablets, it impacted the capacity of retention data. Which causes wast amount of variety data store in storage, the contents include images and videos are hard to search via scolling from gallaries. It adds user frustration to search images throw scrolling or browsing images or videos.


Solution :-

Recent growth in intelligence such as machine learning and modelling for large scale data, user should be able to find the images from gallary with searching by description and information from images. Gallary or photo store from smart devices should have capabilites to search images/videos through descriptive langauge.


Challeges :-
1. Design/Impelement machine learning models for mobile application and should run on as background process on smart devices which has limited memory and CPU.
2. Add more challenges as we progress in solving problems.


Scope:

1. Current scope for RecollectMe for android applications on smart devices.
2. Add scope incrementally as we progress in solving problems. 


High level use cases:-
1. As smart phone user, I should be able to brows/scroll images from Gallary.
2. As smart phone user, I should be able to search images based on captured metadata such as image name, date/time, location, place from photo gallary.
3. As smart phone user, I should be able to search images with description from images such as background, color of dress, no of people in the pic, activites in the pics.
4. Design ML algorithm or model for training images from Photo gallary for searches.
5. Add more as we progress further.


What we will learn:-
1. Design adroid application for photo gallary.
2. Machine learning models and implementation for descriptive based search.
3. Add more upon progress.
